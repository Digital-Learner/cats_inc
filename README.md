Cats Incorporated is a new delivery service, where all your purchases are packaged by cats.

It's an example Rails app that's being used in the mentoring sessions.

Currently: all the tests are wrong.

These tests all run, pass, and give good coverage when they are correctly organised into the right folders.
    
But! They've all been moved out of the right folders, and some are poorly named. So most of them don't work.

Fork this repo, check it out on your computer, move the spec files to the places you think they should go and make sure they all have good names. Once all the tests are passing and you're happy with it, make a pull request with your changes back into this repo.
